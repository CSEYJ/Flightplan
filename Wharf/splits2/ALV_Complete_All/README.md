# Info
This example is the basis for
[Figure 7](https://flightplan.cis.upenn.edu/flightplan.pdf#figure.caption.13)
in the Flightplan paper, and builds on other examples:
it is based on ALV_Complete_2_FW, and extended with ALV_Complete_1_hl3new, ALV_Complete_1_hl3_unsplit and ALV_Complete_2_hl3new.

## What you see
This is an example of deploying Flightplan to a network with complex requirements.
It features different programs, some of which are split in different ways, executing simultaneously in the same network.
This example shows how to do this in a local way, scoping each program to its resources.
[Section 7.1.1](https://flightplan.cis.upenn.edu/flightplan.pdf#subsubsection.7.1.1) describes this further.
