# Info
This experiment features the [Crosspod](../../splits/ALV_Complete/README.md) program split into six parts: the forwarding logic is kept on the switch, and the booster logic is offloaded to separate supporting devices, one for each booster function.

## What you see
Similar to [Crosspod](../../splits/ALV_Complete/README.md) except that traffic passes through the supporting devices.


# Code
The [scripted experiments](tests.sh) are based on those for [Crosspod](../../splits/ALV_Complete/README.md).
