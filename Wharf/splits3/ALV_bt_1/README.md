# Info
This example splits [ALV_bt](../ALV_bt/README.md) into two parts to offload
some of the tunnelling logic to a supporting device.
This device is labelled **BT** and attaches to **p0e1**.

## What you see
Similar to [ALV_bt](../ALV_bt/README.md) except that traffic passes through the supporting device.


# Code

See the [README for ALV_bt](../ALV_bt/README.md).
