\begin{abstract}
Applications running on a data center network typically expect good performance
from a network whose use they compete for in an uncoordinated manner, but
meeting such applications' needs in a high-performance environment is a
persistent challenge. This is exacerbated in the presence of rolling failures
within hosts and networks, which is a necessary feature of networks at data
center scale.

Research on data center networking has sought to provide the means to
express and execute performance-related preferences to better serve
applications by better utilising the network.

(Something about the fit of current techniques, depending on the set of use-cases we ultimately settle on.)

In this work we describe Tango, a distributed framework comprising network
boosters that can be dynamically activated and chained to improve the network's
performance to better serve applications. Boosters are coupled close to the two
communicating endpoints in the data center, and the intermediate network is
oblivious to the boosting. The boosters can execute in software or on
reconfigurable hardware, depending on a host's capabilities and the
application's priorities.

(Something about why this is truly excellent wrt the state of the art, and what performance objectives this allows us to realise.)

\section{Introduction}

\section{Mishaps in datacenter networks}
Gather from the literature:
Congestion,
Corruption (link/interface failure,
Node (host/switch) failure, etc.
Scheduler error?

\section{Mitigating network mishaps}
Deciding where to locate the booster:
in software on the host,
in hardware on the host,
or at the ToR.
(Presumably anywhere else would make limited sense.)

Control process to determine when to activate boosters, and possibly what parameters to use.

\section{Use-cases}

\subsection{Forward Error Correction}
Need to specify topology early on.

\subsection{TBD}

\section{Implementation}
Some bits done in P4, and other bits that can co-/entirely run on FPGA or a host's CPU.

\section{Evaluation}
Ultimately we'd like to show application-level service quality, but
network-level performance might be a pragmatic surrogate.

Traffic generator to saturate a 10+G link.

Emulating packet loss and packet corruption -- can both these be done using a P4 program?

Showing the traffic makes it through $2 < H < 5$ hops in the presence of
network mishaps, and that application-level performance is sustained.
(As a control experiment, showing that non-boosted traffic leads to application degradation.)
