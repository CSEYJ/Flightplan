\section{Introduction}

In this paper we describe \OurSys, an in-network distributed mitigation for
faulty links.  We claim that our design requires minimal configuration, is
transparent to end-points~\cite{Saltzer84end-to-endarguments} and does not
conflict with existing network architecture choices (e.g., what topology to use
and how to route over it). We model \OurSys using ns-3 and evaluate
implementations for CPUs and FPGAs.

  \caption{\label{fig:example-net}An example network consisting of four
    switches (S1-S4) and four hosts (H1-H4). Faulty links are shown as dashed lines.
    Each link is assumed to have capacity $R$ unless the link is faulty, in
    which case it has capacity $F < R$.  In this example, the failing link
    diminishes the bandwidth of H1.}
