\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we described \OurSys, a new in-network mitigation
against failing network links. It monitors network ports to infer
abnormal loss, and uses forward error-correction across lossy links.
Adjacent switches coordinate to set up complementary encoding and
decoding stages for FEC across failing links.  We prototyped the FEC
encoding and decoding stages on x86 systems for ease of development
and also prototyped the encoding stage to run on reconfigurable
hardware.

Our implementation is a work in progress, and we are extending it to
carry out the decoding stage on reconfigurable hardware, too.
Another improvement consists of using all the network ports on our
development board and scaling up our testing to use all available
bandwidth.
Finally, we will add the configuration and coordination logic to
specify traffic classes and the parameters to the FEC.

We also plan to extend this work further to explore autonomous
network resource management, going beyond in-network mitigation of
faulty links. We will explore in-network services that require
a level of programmability that exceeds P4's current capabilities,
such as data deduplication and compression and build on the system
described in this paper.
