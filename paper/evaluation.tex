\section{Evaluation}
We evaluate \OurSys using different types of traffic to measure its improvement
to application-level behaviour in the presence of lossy links.

%We run \OurSys in 3 configurations: outside the switch, on the switch, and in the switch.
%Time how quickly \OurSys reacts to failing links.
