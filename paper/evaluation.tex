\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
% We evaluate \OurSys using different types of traffic to measure its improvement
% to application-level behaviour in the presence of lossy links.

We evaluate \OurSys with microbenchmarks and network simulation to answer these questions:
\begin{itemize}

\item What are the resource requirements for \OurSys with different levels of 
error correction?

\item How much does \OurSys improve application throughput across lossy links?

%\item What benefit can \OurSys have to networks at large?
\end{itemize}



% We
% evaluate three possible deployment models for \OurSys: an FPGA external to
% the switch; a software implementation running on the switch CPU; and an ASIC  
% implementation integrated into the switch forwarding engine.

\subsubsection{Event-based simulation}
Figure/Table~\ref{tab:simulation} shows something about the overall benefit of \OurSys from a network-wide perspective, based on an ns-3 event-driven simulation.
This model has better fidelity than the previous model, but is not run on real hardware. This also means we can simulate larger networks. Here we present data for experiments that are comparable to the setups used in the other evaluations.

\subsection{Encoder Microbenchmarks}
\iffalse
Here we evaluate the implementation directly, not using a model.
Latency and throughput graphs for experiments involving different loss rates, and the encoder working on the CPU and FPGA.
Note: we have not optimised the CPU implementation.
\fi
We measured the performance of our current encoder implementation, which
has fixed parameters $k = 8$ and $h = 4$ and handles only packets with 1024-byte payloads.
Packets were supplied to the FPGA with the packet generator of DPDK 17.08.1.
At the output, we measured a throughput of 9.025 Gbps over a 10-minute period,
nearly saturating the 10-Gbps link.

\iffalse
To ensure \OurSys's effect observed in the model are practical, we directly measured the 
full throughput of our encoder implementation in FPGA. For our benchmark, the encoder is configed to use
k=8 and h=4. Packets are generated by a tool based
on DPDK library, and are fed to the board (as is specified above~(\S\ref{sec:implementation})) through
a 10Gbps link. The average outgoing throughput measured during a 10 minutes test is 9.025Gbps.
Considering the overhead from other parts of the system, we believe the link is actually close
to being saturated, which is our basic assumption in evaluations.
\fi

As a contrast, we also evaluated the CPU implementaion (not optimised). Under the same deployment, the throughput measured is 
(\$CPUVALUE), (\$RATIO) lower compared to FPGA.

\subsection{FPGA resource consumption}
Table~\ref{tab:microbenchmarks} shows the resource requirements for the FPGA implementations of
\OurSys with different $k$ and $h$ parameters.  The device
has 1824 BRAMs, 548160 flip-flops, and 274080 LUTs.
%CPU cycles for the software
%implementation are measured using Linux performance counters and averaged over
%X packets,
FPGA requirements are obtained from the Xilinx synthesis tool, and the
timing statistics are measured using ingress and egress timestamps on
the switch.
