\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
% We evaluate \OurSys using different types of traffic to measure its improvement
% to application-level behaviour in the presence of lossy links.

We evaluate \OurSys with microbenchmarks and network simulation to answer these questions:
\begin{itemize}

\item What are the resource requirements for \OurSys with different levels of 
error correction?

\item How much does \OurSys improve application throughput across lossy links?

%\item What benefit can \OurSys have to networks at large?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Setup}

  \caption{\label{fig:exp_topo} Testbed topology for benchmarks.}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:exp_topo} depicts the testbed we used to benchmark \OurSys.
The two traffic generation hosts are each connected to different \OurSys
enabled switches, which are themselves connected by a 10 GbE link. The
switches are Wedge BF32-100X's with Barefoot Tofino~\cite{tofino} P4 
programmable forwarding engines. \lei{TODO: fix cite}

% We
% evaluate three possible deployment models for \OurSys: an FPGA external to
% the switch; a software implementation running on the switch CPU; and an ASIC  
% implementation integrated into the switch forwarding engine.

\subsubsection{Event-based simulation}
Figure/Table~\ref{tab:simulation} shows something about the overall benefit of \OurSys from a network-wide perspective, based on an ns-3 event-driven simulation.
This model has better fidelity than the previous model, but is not run on real hardware. This also means we can simulate larger networks. Here we present data for experiments that are comparable to the setups used in the other evaluations.

\subsection{Encoder Microbenchmarks}
\iffalse
Here we evaluate the implementation directly, not using a model.
Latency and throughput graphs for experiments involving different loss rates, and the encoder working on the CPU and FPGA.
Note: we have not optimised the CPU implementation.
\fi
To ensure \OurSys's effect observed in the model are practical, we directly measured the 
full throughput of our encoder implementation in FPGA. For our benchmark, the encoder is configed to use
k=8 and h=4. Packets are generated by a tool based
on DPDK library, and are fed to the board (as is specified above~(\S\ref{sec:implementation})) through
a 10Gbps link. The average outgoing throughput measured during a 10 minutes test is 9.025Gbps.
Considering the overhead from other parts of the system, we believe the link is actually close
to being saturated, which is our basic assumption in evaluations.

As a contrast, we also evaluated the CPU implementaion (not optimised). Under the same deployment, the throughput measured is 
(\$CPUVALUE), (\$RATIO) lower compared to FPGA.

\subsection{FPGA resource consumption}
Table~\ref{tab:microbenchmarks} shows the resource requirements for the FPGA implementations of
\OurSys with different H and K parameters.
%CPU cycles for the software
%implementation are measured using Linux performance counters and averaged over
%X packets,
FPGA requirements are obtained from the Xilinx compiler, and the
timing statistics are measured using ingress and egress timestamps on
the switch.
