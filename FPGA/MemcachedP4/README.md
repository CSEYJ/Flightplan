#Memcached P4
Testing

- To build the project, please build the MemcachedVivadoHLS first.<br>
- Use run\_C.sh for C simulation. The input packet is Packet.user and the output is Packet\_expect.pcap. (Currently the packet ../../Mempackets/set16.pcap is in use and the corresponding output should be Packet\_to\_Compare.pcap). <br>
- Use run\_RTL.sh for RTL simulation.
